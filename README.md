# GEOG 495 LAB 03

## This repository contains two GeoJSON converted files from COVID-19 shapefile statistics in the United States and displays summary statistics, such as case rates, deaths, and case counts.

### Map1.html description:
Map1.html contains COVID-19 case rate data in the US by county, displayed in choropleth values. Javascript code implements a
hover functionality that displays the number of deaths, as well as the corresonding county name.

__Potential users of this map include public health officials, researchers and academics, as well as the general public to understand the holistic
takeaway of COVID case rate distribution in the United States.__

__Data sources for this map include__
1) Case Count Data: The COVID-19 case count data is sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau's Explore Census Data platform. The specific dataset used is available at Census.gov.

3) (Basemap) Mapbox: Maps, Navigation, Search, and Data. (2023). Mapbox.com. https://www.mapbox.com/

### Map2.html description:
Map2.html conveys proportional density of COVID-19 case counts across US counties using a proportional symbol map. The size of the circles corresponds to the number of cases reported in each county, having larger circles showing higher case counts. JavaScript code enables users to view county-level information, including case counts and corresponding county names, by hovering over the circles.

__Potential users of this map include public health officials, researchers, policymakers, and individuals interested in understanding the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases at a county level.__

Basemap: Mapbox provides the basemap used in this visualization. Mapbox is a platform offering mapping and location data services. More information can be found at Mapbox.com.

Projection Transformation: The map projection is transformed to Albers equal-area projection using Mapbox's projection-albers-usa API. This ensures accurate representation of area and preserves spatial relationships in the visualization.
